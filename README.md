# dicePlay
A personal Front-end project with a dice, basing on HTML, CSS (responsive, bootstrap 4, Material UI) and JavaScript.
- Dice rolls automatically, and the player presses the STOP button to get a number for the next stage via JS functions (Event Listening technique).Â 
- Player adds tasks that they intend to complete (LocalStorage technique).
<!-- - Scrolling the page and seeing a smoothing 'effect' appear (CSS and JS Event Listening technique). -->
